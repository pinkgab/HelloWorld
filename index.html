      HTML is the formatting of paragraphs and headings on 
      websites. It is the nitty gritty of how everything is
      spaced out and how the letters appear wether bolded or 
      a heading or title. It has everything specifyed wether
      it is a paragraph or a heading.

    <p>I chose this class because I took a programming 
    class last year. I really liked working with HTML and CSS
    so I figured I might enjoy the class this year. My brother 
    originally inspired me to try programing because he took a 
    programming class in Highschool and really enjoyed it so I 
    thought that I should give it a try.</p>
